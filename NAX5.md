# NAX5 Client

Native Windows client for NAX5. This repository is a **minimal fork** of [streetpea/chiaki-ng](https://github.com/streetpea/chiaki-ng) at **v1.10.0**.

Root [README.md](README.md) is the product/user-facing note. This file is the developer guide. Upstream licenses and notices stay in [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md), [FORK-MAINTENANCE.md](FORK-MAINTENANCE.md), [COPYING](COPYING), and [LICENSES](LICENSES).

Current branch: `task4-auto-remote-play`. Record tagged releases in workspace [RELEASES.md](../RELEASES.md).

## Purpose

Give an authenticated NAX5 user a Play button that:

1. talks to NAX5 Backend for login, Console assignment, and Session lifecycle;
2. receives **transient** Remote Play connection material;
3. starts the **existing** chiaki-ng stream session against a physical PS5.

NAX5 uses chiaki-ng because Remote Play already works there. The product does not invent a second streaming stack.

## Owns

- NAX5 identity, settings isolation, Windows packaging
- Native control-plane HTTP client (`X-Session-Token`)
- Session reservation / connection / connected / fail / end
- Transient `StreamSessionConnectInfo` adapter
- Product and operator QML chrome (`LoginView`, `Nax5PlayPanel`, `Nax5AccountBar`, `Nax5OperatorPanel`)
- Process logging (`nax5processlog`) and client-reports upload (`nax5clientreport`)

## Does not own

- Remote Play protocol, decode/render, audio, input, pacing, codecs, crypto, streaming sockets
- Django API behavior or Caddy routing
- Website UI
- Durable PS5 secret storage (backend runtime data)

## Main entry points

- `gui/src/main.cpp` — Qt application; QSettings org/app come from `Nax5Runtime`
- `gui/src/qml/Main.qml` + `gui/src/qml/LoginView.qml` — login gate, then product UI
- `gui/src/nax5/nax5authcontroller.cpp` — native login / me / logout
- `gui/src/nax5/session/nax5sessioncontroller.cpp` — Play orchestration
- `gui/src/nax5/connection/nax5transienthost.cpp` — fills chiaki `StreamSessionConnectInfo`
- `gui/src/qmlbackend.cpp` — existing stream session owner (`createSession`, disconnect)
- `gui/src/nax5/nax5processlog.cpp` — `%AppData%/NAX5/NAX5/log/nax5_*.log`
- `gui/src/nax5/nax5clientreport.cpp` — ZIP export + `POST /api/v1/client-reports/`

Default API base is `https://cloudgta6.com`. Override locally with `NAX5_API_BASE_URL` (loopback `http` allowed).

Native login uses `/_allauth/app/v1/auth/login`. Session APIs live under `/api/v1/sessions/` on the **apex** host only (`cloudgta6.com`, not `www`). See `nax5-backend/docs/NATIVE-EDGE-DESIGN.md`.

## Product code location

Put new product logic in:

- `gui/include/nax5/`
- `gui/src/nax5/`
  - `nax5/` — auth, API client, runtime, logging, reports
  - `nax5/session/` — assignment and lifecycle
  - `nax5/connection/` — material parse + transient host

Product QML currently lives next to upstream QML:

- `gui/src/qml/Nax5*.qml`
- `gui/src/qml/LoginView.qml`

Keep QML product-named. Avoid new Remote Play behavior in `lib/` or `gui/src/streamsession.cpp`.

Operator mode: env `NAX5_OPERATOR_MODE=1` (or `NAX5_OPERATOR_BUILD`). Operator QSettings are `NAX5/NAX5-Operator` and may use the original chiaki registration flow. Product mode uses `NAX5/NAX5` and must not write `RegisteredHost` / `ManualHost` for Play.

## How Play reaches Remote Play

`Nax5SessionController` reserves a Session, fetches connection material, then calls `nax5FillStreamSessionConnectInfo()` and `QmlBackend::createSession()`. That reuses chiaki-ng `StreamSession`. There is no NAX5 decoder or relay.

Material fields used: host, target, nickname, `regist_key`, `morning`, optional PIN. Keys are overwritten then cleared on `discardMaterial()` / logout. Do not log them.

## Play eligibility

Product Play requires authenticated user, verified email, and `accessStatus == ACTIVE`. Backend reserve also accepts `INVITED`; the client gate is stricter until product UX aligns.

## Logging

| Layer | Path / endpoint |
| --- | --- |
| Process log | `%AppData%/Roaming/NAX5/NAX5/log/nax5_<timestamp>.log` |
| Stream log | same dir, `chiaki_session_<timestamp>.log` (last 5 kept) |
| Manual ZIP | Desktop via `Nax5Session.saveReport()` |
| Automatic report journal | `%AppData%/Roaming/NAX5/NAX5/log/report-queue-v2/`; sanitized, owner-tagged session ZIP parts |
| Server reports | `POST https://cloudgta6.com/api/v1/client-reports/` after a session, when logged in |

Automatic reports contain the complete sanitized process and stream logs captured
for that session, split into bounded ZIP parts below the server limit. Every
journal and part persists the authenticated numeric owner ID; queue selection
filters by that owner. Parts remain until the server acknowledges them. The reconstruction
tool and exact field semantics are documented in
[docs/DIAGNOSTICS-BUILD7.md](docs/DIAGNOSTICS-BUILD7.md).

## Critical invariants

- Do not change Remote Play protocol, video decode/render, audio, controller/input, frame pacing, codec logic, crypto, streaming networking, or renderer/libplacebo without a dedicated architectural decision. See [FORK-MAINTENANCE.md](FORK-MAINTENANCE.md).
- Product-mode disconnect/stop must **not** send the shared PS5 to sleep. `GoToBed()` is operator-mode only (`QmlBackend::closeRequested` / suspend).
- New product features must not break vanilla Remote Play behavior used for diagnostics.
- Session token stays in RAM (`Nax5AuthController::clearSessionToken`). Closing the app requires a new login.
- Do not persist Play connection material in Chiaki host lists.

## Tests

CMake unit tests:

- `gui/src/nax5/nax5authparser_test.cpp`
- `gui/src/nax5/session/nax5sessionparser_test.cpp`
- `gui/src/nax5/connection/nax5connection_test.cpp`

Manual product checks: [docs/acceptance/ALPHA05-USER-TEST.md](docs/acceptance/ALPHA05-USER-TEST.md) and [TEST-MATRIX.md](TEST-MATRIX.md). Older alpha notes are under [docs/acceptance/history/](docs/acceptance/history/).

## Packaging

Full guide: [docs/release/BUILD-LAUNCHER.md](docs/release/BUILD-LAUNCHER.md)

```bash
# one-time
bash scripts/release/setup-msys2-build-env.sh

# MSYS2 MINGW64, clean committed tree
bash scripts/release/build-alpha05-user-pack.sh
```

Output:

- `artifacts/alpha-0.5/NAX5-windows-installer.exe` (primary user download)
- `artifacts/alpha-0.5/NAX5-Alpha-0.5-Windows-x64.zip` (portable fallback for release hosting)

Inno Setup 6 (`ISCC.exe`) is required. Operator/local `.cmd` helpers are **not** included in the user pack.

Record releases in workspace `RELEASES.md` and publish assets to GitHub Releases.
